## All repositories will be maintained on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Aukje)


### Declaration

Now that GitHub CoPilot is here and more and more people seem to think this is a good idea, I feel forced to move all my code to GitLab. Now I do not think moving my code will prevent CoPilot from using my code. As soon as code is published under open source licenses, it can potentially be (mis!)used by things like CoPilot.

I am moving my code, because I dont think this is a good idea and I do see a lot of (potential) issues coming from this and I will try and stay away from actively killing the developer job as much as I can.

If you want to know more about the dark side of GitHub Co-Pilot and why you should stay away from it, I have two YouTube video's you could watch as a good starting point.

Don't believe the hype. Research and think for yourself.

Be save.
